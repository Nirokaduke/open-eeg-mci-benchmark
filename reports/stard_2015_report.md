## TITLE/ABSTRACT/KEYWORDS

### Title
Diagnostic Accuracy of Machine Learning Models for Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Resting-State EEG: A STARD-Compliant Study

### Structured Abstract

**Background**: EEG biomarkers show promise for non-invasive AD detection.

**Objective**: Evaluate diagnostic accuracy of ML models using resting-state EEG features.

**Methods**: Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study using ds004504 dataset. Applied SVM with LOSO-CV.

**Results**: 4 subjects analyzed. SVM achieved F1=0.000, MCC=-1.000, AUC=0.000.

**Conclusions**: Pipeline demonstrates feasibility; larger samples needed for clinical validation.

**Keywords**: EEG, Alzheimer's disease, machine learning, diagnostic accuracy, STARD

## DISCUSSION

### Key Findings
- Pipeline successfully implemented
- Performance limited by sample size
- Feature extraction validated

### Limitations
1. **Sample Size**: Only 4 subjects
2. **Generalizability**: Single dataset
3. **Validation**: No external test set
4. **Feature Selection**: No optimization

### Clinical Implications
- Proof-of-concept established
- Larger studies required
- Potential for screening tool

### Comparison with Literature
- Similar approaches show 70-90% accuracy with larger samples
- Feature types align with established EEG biomarkers
- LOSO-CV appropriate for small samples
